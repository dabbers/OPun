# OPun
I've got a website where I post puns that come up in my day to day life. Be they originals, or contributed.

I have amassed quite a few jokes over the years so I felt like I should release the jokes out into the world.

Thus I give you, Open Pun (OPun). Of course the project name has to be a pun as well. You can use these jokes however you see fit, but I'd enjoy to know who's using them and how.

These puns come from my site at https://punatorium.com where you can find them udpated nearly every other day. I'll try and keep this repository up to date on a monthly basis.
